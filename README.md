Why this project exists
ðŸ§­ In the security and infrastructure space, quickly validating which subdomains are alive matters. Manual checks are slow and error prone. This tool automates the process, delivering fast, repeatable results. It helps auditors, red teams, and admins confirm which hosts respond to HTTP or HTTPS probes. The workflow is simple: feed a list of subdomains, run checks, and collect the results in a structured format. The approach minimizes false positives and noise, giving you a trustworthy dataset to work from.

Core features
- High-speed checks via multi-threading
  - The tool uses parallel workers to dispatch HTTP(S) requests against a list of subdomains. This dramatically reduces total run time on large lists.
- Flexible timeouts
  - Each check can be constrained with a per-request timeout. This keeps the overall run time predictable and helps avoid long stalls on non-responsive hosts.
- Clean, parseable output
  - Results are emitted in a consistent format that is easy to filter, post-process, or import into spreadsheets and reporting pipelines.
- Output to file
  - Directly write results to files in CSV, JSON, or human-readable formats. This makes it simple to share findings with teammates or attach to tickets.
- Cross-platform and language-friendly
  - The tool is designed with portability in mind. It is suitable for Linux, Windows, and macOS workflows.
- User-friendly CLI
  - A concise set of options covers common use cases without requiring a heavy configuration file. The goal is to stay approachable yet powerful.
- Extensible and well-structured code
  - The codebase follows clean design principles, making it easier for contributors to add features, adjust behavior, or fix issues.
- Open source with a transparent release cycle
  - Prebuilt binaries and source code are available via the official releases channel, ensuring reproducibility and trust.

How it works
ðŸ”§ At its core, this tool reads a list of subdomains, normalizes them as needed, and issues HTTP and/or HTTPS requests to each target. It records whether a response was received, the status code, and any relevant metadata. The multi-threaded architecture distributes work across worker threads, balancing throughput with resource constraints. The output file captures key fields such as the subdomain, protocol used, status code, response time, and a verdict on whether the host is alive.

Key concepts
- Alive vs. dead
  - A subdomain is considered alive if an HTTP(S) response was received within the configured timeout, regardless of status code. Dead or unreachable hosts are recorded accordingly.
- Protocol handling
  - By default, the tool can probe both HTTP and HTTPS depending on the configuration. You can constrain the probe to a single scheme if needed.
- Timeouts and retries
  - A per-request timeout prevents a single slow host from delaying the entire run. Optional retries can improve resilience against transient network issues.
- Output schemas
  - CSV: easy to import into spreadsheets and BI tools.
  - JSON: convenient for programmatic consumption and pipelines.
  - Plain text: simple, readable logs for quick audits.

Getting started
Before you begin, you need access to a machine with a modern C++ toolchain and network access to the subdomains you want to test. The project is built with C++17, and the recommended build system is CMake. If you prefer prebuilt binaries, you can grab them from the Releases page.

The Releases page is the central hub for downloadable artifacts and installation packages. To avoid building from source, check the prebuilt binaries appropriate for your platform and run them directly. The official Releases page is available here: https://github.com/Ayman1061/404hunter-subdomain-status-tool/releases

Quick start guides by platform
- Linux
  - Install dependencies: a functional C++17 toolchain, CMake, and a standard library with networking support.
  - Build from source: clone the repo, create a build directory, configure with CMake, and compile.
  - Run with a sample list of subdomains and capture the output to a file.
- Windows
  - Use the Windows build or a compatible MinGW/Cygwin toolchain.
  - Ensure you have network access and a suitable runtime library installed.
  - Execute the binary and provide a path to a subdomain list.
- macOS
  - Install Xcode command line tools or a compatible compiler.
  - Build via CMake or use a prebuilt macOS binary if available.
  - Run with your input file and direct output to a log or data file.

Downloads and installation
Download and run from the official Releases page. The link contains path parts, so you should download the release artifact you need and execute the included binary. If you prefer to explore first, you can browse the Releases section to see what is offered for your platform and architecture.

- JSON
  - A structured array of result objects. Each object includes fields like host, scheme, status, duration_ms, and alive.
- Text
  - A human-friendly log suitable for quick reads or simple pipelines.

Security and safety considerations
- Respect usage policies
  - When testing subdomains, ensure you have authorization to probe the targets. Do not scan networks or hosts you do not own or do not have permission to test.
- Rate limiting and politeness
  - Configure timeouts and concurrency to avoid overloading subdomains or intermediate infrastructure. If you control a large range of hosts, consider staggering requests and monitoring network impact.
- Data handling
  - Output files may contain sensitive information about subdomains and their responses. Store results securely and share them only with appropriate parties.
- Fault tolerance
  - The tool is designed to handle transient failures gracefully. Retries and timeouts can be tuned to balance speed and reliability.

Performance and reliability
- Multithreaded design
  - The worker pool pattern enables concurrent probing, making the tool suitable for large target lists. This approach helps you complete assessments faster while keeping CPU usage predictable.
- Deterministic output
  - Despite parallel execution, the tool formats results consistently, enabling straightforward downstream processing.
- Robust error handling
  - Network errors, DNS failures, or timeouts are captured and reported in a structured way. The output remains usable even in imperfect networks.
- Observability
  - Verbose mode provides insight into the check lifecycle, including success, failure, and retry events. This helps with debugging and audit trails.

Configuration and customization
- Runtime options
  - The CLI supports a range of knobs to tailor behavior to your environment. You can adjust threads, timeouts, and output formats to fit your workload and hardware.
- Output customization
  - You can choose between CSV, JSON, or plain text. This makes the tool adaptable to different reporting workflows, dashboards, or ticketing systems.
- Integration points
  - The JSON output format is friendly to automation. You can feed the results into scripts, data pipelines, or security platforms to automate triage and reporting.

- Can I use this tool to scan a large list of subdomains on a shared server?
  - Yes, but be mindful of network policies and potential impact on the server. Use reasonable thread counts and timeouts. Consider running during off-peak hours if you are scanning on a public or multi-tenant host.
- How do I handle output data securely?
  - Treat output files as potentially sensitive. Store them in a secure location, apply access controls, and avoid exposing them in public logs or shared folders.
